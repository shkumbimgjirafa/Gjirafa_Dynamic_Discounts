/// <summary>
/// Cross-dock (supplier-fulfilled) markdown — the lane for SKUs we DON'T hold locally but sell by
/// ordering from a supplier once a customer buys (KsStock == 0, SupplierStock &gt; 0). SELL_THROUGH and
/// DEAD_STOCK both abstain on these (they gate on locally-held stock), and elasticity often lacks the
/// dense price history to fit, so without this lane a selling supplier SKU never gets a recommendation
/// and just sits at its anchor price forever.
///
/// A sell-through/dead-stock HYBRID, driven by sales status because there is no on-hand denominator:
///  - Branch A (selling, Qty90 &gt; 0): HOLD the working price. The discount that produced the sale is
///    load-bearing — clawing it back would likely kill the demand it unlocked — so holding is an ACTIVE
///    vote at the current price (it anchors the blend against a co-voting margin-tier that would raise it).
///    Only deepen further when velocity is decaying; never raise.
///  - Branch B (not selling, Qty90 == 0): a soft progressive markdown from the current price toward the
///    band margin floor as the zero-sale streak grows. Softer than dead-stock (gentler start, slower
///    cadence). Unlike dead-stock it is bounded by the NORMAL margin floor, never the 50%-of-cost tunnel:
///    nothing is sunk (we never bought the unit), so there is no capital to recover below the floor —
///    a sale below it would just lose money on every fulfilled order.
///
/// The lane is monotonic: it never raises the price except the one floor-protection lift (a SKU already
/// priced below the margin floor is corrected UP to it). When a tunnelled SKU finally sells, Qty90 turns
/// positive and Branch A holds the achieved price — the markdown is sticky, the progress is kept.
///
/// It votes at a deliberately modest weight so that when elasticity (a stronger signal) also fires, the
/// weighted blend defers to elasticity; when elasticity is absent — the common case for supplier SKUs —
/// this lane carries the vote.
